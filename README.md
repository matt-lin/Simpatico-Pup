####How the app addresses customer's need
<br />SimpaticoPup is a website that collect crowd sourced data about the health, 
temperament and suitability of pet dogs of various breeds, and from various 
sources (dog breeders). This site can reduce and discourage irresponsible dog 
breeding (by giving dog lovers a clear and superior way to identify responsibly 
raised, healthy puppies) and can even ultimately improve the health and 
temperament of the pet dogs being produced.
